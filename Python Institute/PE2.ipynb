Responding to this demand, a number of fuzzy string comparison algorithms has been created and implemented. These algorithms are able to find strings which aren't equal in the Python sense, but are **similar**.\n",

If this problem interests you, you can find out more about it here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamming_distance.

In general, the `BufferedIOBase` is able to process any file, while `TextIOBase` is a specialized class dedicated to processing text files (i.e. files containing human-visible texts divided into lines using new-line markers). Thus, the streams can be divided into **binary** and **text** ones.\n",
